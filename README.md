Capstone project 

** make sure you include how to install minerl, explain the project, then to clone this repo and run python run_pipeline.py (we can change the name of this file if we want to) 

** I made a google collab that I sent a while back to the discord. maybe that is something we can put in here. 



**Since we didn't find any installation guides that worked/were thorough enough, we made our own (see below)!
